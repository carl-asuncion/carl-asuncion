- 👋 Hi, I’m @carl-asuncion, currently a Database Coordinator for a cheese company.
- 👀 I’m interested in continuous learning. It might sound boring, but, personally, it is fun and very fulfilling for me. It expands my knowledge espcially for my career, giving me plenty of ideas to work on that will either contribute my workplace or myself.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Networking and Administration Fundamentals and Full-Stack Web Development.

- 📫 You can reach me at casuncion.official@gmail.com for any questions. I would like to know more about you and how we can possibly work together in the future.
